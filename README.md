# Neural Network

The [Juypter Notebook](venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb) in the repo uses neural network deep learning to attempt to predict if a venture captialist investment<br>
will result in a business becoming successful.<br>
<br>
I made the Notebook with the ablity to be ran in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Olegreg762/Neural_Networks/blob/main/venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb) or another IDE.
